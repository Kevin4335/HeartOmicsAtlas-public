Recent studies have extensively profiled human fetal and adult hearts using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)1-9 and human adult hearts using spatial transcriptomics1,10,11; however, fundamental questions regarding SAN developmental biology remain unresolved, including the key regulators of pacemaker cell fate decisions and the role of cell–cell interactions. Moreover, experimental models to directly interrogate electrical coupling and functional integration between the SAN and working cardiac chambers in a whole-heart setting remain largely lacking. Here, we integrate single-nucleus multiomics (sn-multiomics) with single-cell–resolution spatial transcriptomics to resolve the cellular architecture and transcriptional regulatory landscape of the human fetal SAN. We map interactions between the SAN and autonomic neurons (ANs) and identify the neuregulin (NRG) signaling pathway as a critical regulator of SAN development."}

Electrical activity within the CCS originates in the sinoatrial node (SAN), the heart’s primary pacemaker, which generates spontaneous impulses that determine heart rate. These impulses propagate through the atria, triggering atrial contraction and ventricular filling, before reaching the atrioventricular (AV) node, where conduction is transiently delayed optimizing ventricular preload. The signal then travels through the bundle of His, bifurcates into the right and left bundle branches, and disperses via the Purkinje fiber network, synchronizing ventricular contraction and enabling effective pumping of blood to the lungs and systemic circulation. The precise spatiotemporal coordination of this system is essential for normal cardiac function."}

To identify key transcriptional regulators, we analyzed chromatin accessibility profiles at the single-cell level using the chromVAR package.

Leveraging the multimodal nature of the dataset, we prioritized TFs that met independent criteria across both gene expression and chromatin accessibility analyses. Specifically, we performed two statistical tests using the Wilcoxon rank-sum method: one on gene expression and the other on chromVAR-derived motif accessibility scores. TFs with statistically significant p-values in both datasets were considered high-confidence regulators.
